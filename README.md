## Understanding Company's Ideal Customers by performing analysis and segmentation using Machine Learning Algorithms!

## _`A brand is what a business does,`_ <br> _`Reputation is what people remember!`_

_Developing an amazing product is one of the hardest challenges that a company can overcome and
one of the biggest predictors of success. But strong customer relations is what will truly determine
the success of a business._

_At its core, customer relationship management (CRM) is all of the activities, strategies and
technologies that companies use to manage their interactions with their current and potential
customers. A saying frequently heard and said in many businesses is "customer is king."_

_Today's consumers have more industry influence than they've ever had in the past, allowing them to
focus on more than just the product that you're selling them. Now, consumers are interested in what
you're selling them, how you're selling it, and what happens after you've sold it to them._

_To meet the demands for greater customer experiences, companies must focus on managing their
customer relationships. Strong customer relations are essential for building customer loyalty and
retaining current customers. This means understanding what is required to ensure top-quality
customer relationships and create great experiences with your customers._

_Positive customer relations can result in an array of benefits for your company, including more
potential leads and higher customer retention rates. To narrow it down, here are several top benefits
that positive customer relations can provide for your company._

- _Customer Retention_
- _Customer Loyalty_
- _Customer Satisfaction_
- _Customer Feedback_

# For Solving this Usecase, What I have done is :
- Collected the data and organized it to form a meaningful dataset.
- Checked for null values and took care of it.
- Observed the data to form meaningful insights!
<br><br>
- Did Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset.
- Used correlations to form a heatmap.



# For Visualizations, i used :
- Visualizations were made by using Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries..!!
![visualize](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73397927/175773985-a8800afe-f751-4d44-be82-45401a12e475.jpg)



# Did Data Pre-Processing and Feature Selection Engineering :
- Made Binary Classifications Using :
- Label Encoder 
- and Standard Scaler
<br> To fit and transform Numerical and Categorical Column values.



# And then I made Dimentionality Reduction using PCA :
_Dimensionality reduction is way to reduce the complexity of a model and avoid overfitting.<br><br>
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm used to compress a dataset onto a lower-dimensional
feature subspace with the goal of maintaining most of the relevant information._

- Fitted the scaled data
- Transformed it to meaningful columns for better analysis.


# Now the Clusters :
_Visualized the end predicted results using Clusters_
- Visualizing it in reduced dimension.


# Agglomerative clustering :
- Fitted the model
- Plotted the end result.


# Now, Analyzed the above made clusters :
_by distributing them into groups above and below_

- _0: High spending and average income_
- _1: High consumption and high income_
- _2: Low spending and low income_
- _3: High spending and low income_

## _And hence, made a final Cluster profile based on two basic features: Income and Expenditure._ 

# _And for the conclusion -_
### _From the above, we can say that the customer characters are segmented beautifully._
